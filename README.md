# SmartTank
Embedded systems final project
The SmartTank is a Bluetooth controlled tank with a miniature nerf turret. The microcontroller (PIC16f877a) manages tank movement and firing.
The tank fires projectiles using a controlled method of launch. SmartTank's HC-05 Bluetooth module (interfaced through a mobile application) offers remote control. The module simplifies smartphone tank management and on-demand shooting, improving user experience and system flexibility. The launching process is regulated by DC motors and a Servomotor.
